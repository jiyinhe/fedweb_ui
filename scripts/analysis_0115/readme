This directory contains the analysis scripts for the gain-based simulation results.
These scripts can be used to generate the same plots/stats for previous experiments on effort.

1. Influence of parameter on user gain: anaParam.py

depedent variable: gain@10, gain@20, gain@50
independent variables: lambda, prior_type(random vs. prior)


2. comparing systems: anaPerQuery.py

per-query: score@basic vs. score@facet - score@basic
Relation between difficulty of a query with a basic interface and its benefit from using a faceted interface.

3. analysis of the user data -- Marc should have those scripts.
