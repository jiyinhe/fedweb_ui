Simulate user quality by smoothing the filter selection parameter alpha. 
The larger the smooth, the closer the filter selection prior distribution is close to uniform.

- analyze the magnitude of the smoothing parameter to add
- generate results of simulation with simulation_smooth.py
- analyze the results --> how good the users should be?
