This is used for judge crawled fedweb pages
The interface is adapted from the fw_userstudy interface.
The code is a branch "fedsearch_judge" of the original code in the github.

- the app is called judgement
- database: fedsearch, which contains the crawled data
- data: should be the crawled pages (be careful with the path stored in the database)
