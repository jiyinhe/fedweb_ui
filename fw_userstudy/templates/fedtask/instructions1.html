	<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
    In this game you collect documents about the <span class="emph_c">keyword
    query</span> at the <span class="emph_c">top</span> of the page.</p>
<p>
    Your task is to click on <span class="emph_c">10</span> documents relevant to
    the query in as <span class="emph_c">few clicks</span>  as possible.
</p>
<p>
    If it is relevant it a <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok emph_c"
    style="color:green"></span> will appear.  If it is not relevant a <span
    class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove emph_c" style="color:red"></span> will
    appear.
</p>
<p>
    What makes a document <span class="emph_c">relevant</span>? Well, you have to
    find out. To help you, before each round, we provide two example
    documents, one relevant and one irrelevant, and a description of
    why. If you are ready to go press <span class="btn
    btn-success">Let's get started</span>. During the game the description is
    available through this button:  <span class="btn
    btn-success">Show explanations and examples of relevant/irrelevant results</span>.
</br>
    A tip: You may see duplicated results and these should be judged
    independently.
</p>
<p>
    On the right of the page, you can see how many clicks you have left
    (starting with <span class="emph_c">50</span> clicks) and how many relevant
    documents you still need to select. The more clicks you have left after
    selecting 10 relevant documents, the higher your score!  You can check your
    score at <a href="{% url fedtask.views.highscores %}">Highscores</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In case you feel a query is especially difficult for you, you can decide to 
    given up after 25 clicks. 
    A <span class="btn btn-danger">I give up!</span> button will show up then. 
</p>
<p>
    <span class="emph_c">Note: if you give up, you will not receive any points for that query! </span>
</p>

<p>
</p>
	<!--p>
If you are not able to find 10 relevant documents in 100 clicks,
you can have another try with the next topic. If you don't want
to look for more related documents for a certain topic, you can
click "next topic" to select a new topic.
