	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<p>
	In the game you should imagine that you want to know more
	about a topic that is mentioned on top of the page.
	</p>
	<p>
	Your task is to select <span class="emph">10</span> relevant documents about the topic in
	as <span class="emph">few</span> clicks as possible.
	</p>
	
	<p>Below the description of the topic, a list of different documents
will be shown. You can click on the documents to indicate that
you would use that document to gather more information about the
topic. If you select a relevant document, it will be highlighted
in green and a <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok emph" style="color:green"></span> 
will appear on the right of the title.
If the document you selected is not relevant, it will be
highlighted in red and a <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove emph" style="color:red"></span> 
will appear on the right.
	</p>
	<p>
On the left of the page, you can filter the documents based 
on the categories they belong to.

On the right of the page, you can see how many clicks you have 
left (starting with <span class="emph">50</span> clicks) and how many relevant documents 
you still need to select. The more clicks you have left after 
selecting 10 relevant documents, the higher your score!

You can check your score at <a href="{% url fedtask.views.highscores %}">Highscores</a>.
	</p>
	<!--p>
If you are not able to find 10 relevant documents in 100 clicks,
you can have another try with the next topic. If you don't want
to look for more related documents for a certain topic, you can
click "next topic" to select a new topic.
	</p-->
