Thank you for helping us to make search interfaces better. In this
pre-questionnaire we would like to get a better picture of who you
are. We will tread this information confidentially and will not share
your personal information or identity with anyone outside our research
team. 
</ br>
</ br>
To develop better search interfaces we need to observe how people are
currently using these systems. Therefore we log all activities with
our search interface. We anonymize this log data by using identifiers
instead of names and replacing queries that could lead back to your
identity with placeholders. We would like to ask for your permission
to use and share this anonymized log data for research purposes. 
</ br>
</ br>
Please note that you are free to quit the session at any time.
